# Random_Password_Generator

- Project Description: Our randomly generated password program will help users create strong passwords which protect users from unauthorized attempts to view private information. Users will be given options for the length and strength of their new password. As we continue to work and build on this project, in the future, we plan to add the ability to create an account and store passwords that have been created.
